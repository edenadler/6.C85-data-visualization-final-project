              Debt is both a driver to migrate to repay debt and a means to pay for migration 
              (<a href="https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jlca.12385" target="_blank">Heidbrink, 2019</a>).

              Increasingly, migrants turn to high-interest loans from unregulated lenders 
              (i.e., individual lenders, notaries, cooperatives, and banks), 
              using land, homes, vehicles, or goods as collateral 
              (<a href="https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jlca.12385" target="_blank">Heidbrink, 2019</a>).

            <p>
              Families face interest rates ranging from 2.5 to 15 percent, compounded monthly, 
            meaning remigration may be the only viable means of debt repayment
